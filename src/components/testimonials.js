            <h3>What Our Students Say</h3>
            <div>
            <p>Actually, I wasn't expecting so much compared to random online classes.
                 When I joined, I didn't expect it to be this intense. 
                The training was intensive, 
                they didn't keep us on the surface they were digging deep into the course. 
                The last few weeks were really tasking for me and I wasn't expecting much volume of work,
                I was really surprised by it all.
                I honestly appreciate Youlead and I promise to put all I have learnt to work.</p>

            <p>My journey with Youlead was amazing. 
                I was one of the persons that received sponsorship in the program.
                I experienced a lot of commitment more than I expected.
